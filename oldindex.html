				<p>Listed above are a few of my astories from the Columbia Missourian that I phtographed during my time as a visual journalist at the Missourian.  I was able to take several photos, and I also directed and recorded a mini documentary.  I had lots of fun working for the Missourian, and I believe it helped me develop professionally.</p>
